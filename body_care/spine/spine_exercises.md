# Exercises

The full set of exercises below covers most of what seems relevant. When normal condition is restored, the simpified quick subset for 2-3 minutes every morning: [U1-1](#u1-1-), [U1-2](#u1-2-), [U1-3](#u1-3), [U1-4](#u1-4).

**Note: calm and smooth movements. Self-massage: at the start and during pauses one hand may reach and touch the back to help relax the muscles along the spine.**

## D1-2

Calm and smooth movements that usually don't provoke extra pain and tend to provide a moderate relief.

**Note: when the legs move in one direction, the chest and arms can gently be turned to the opposite direction. The movements should be slow, calm, and smooth. As the legs are turned in one direction there may be a pause: the opposite hand may reach and touch the back to help relax the muscles along the spine.**
